     <hr>
     <p>The iPhone 16 will bring notable changes to the iPhone lineup, with Apple expected to increase the size of the iPhone 16 Pro to 6.3 inches and the size of the iPhone 16 Pro Max to 6.9 inches, marking the first size upgrade in several years. The size changes will be limited to the iPhone 16 Pro models, with the iPhone 16 models to stay the same size as the iPhone 15 models. While the iPhone 16 models won't get bigger, they will get some minor design tweaks thanks to extra buttons, but for the most part, both the standard iPhone 16 models and the Pro models will look like the iPhone 15 and 15 Pro models.<br>Apple is designing new A-series chips for the iPhone 16 lineup, built on the latest N3E 3-nanometer node. We could see some improvements to efficiency and performance, but we haven't yet heard details on just what we can expect. The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro could use different chips, with the higher-end chip limited to the Pro models.</p>
